# PythonLab
PythonLab is a scientific computing environment for python.

### Why PythonLab
Existing python environments (IDEs or notebook environments like IPython) have several disadvantages for the scientific 
programmer who is more of a scientist and less of a programmer.
* Python environments are hard to set up. Python installations need to be managed separately from the IDE/notebook.
* There isn't much support for command history or workspace browsing
* Documentation is poor

PythonLab will focus on ease of use for the non-expert user. It will aim to be a sandboxed and curated environment while
maintaining full compatibility with python. There will only be a single installation to take care of. No more managing python,
pip and IDE/notebook separately.
